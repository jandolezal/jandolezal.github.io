I am a project manager and analyst interested in sustainability and renewable energy who is building expertise in software development, data wrangling and data analysis. Since I discovered Python in the context of web scraping and data analysis I can't stop learning about open source tools and putting them to use.

Here, I will try to write about some of my small projects published on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/jandolezal) and maybe some other stuff.

This is a static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
